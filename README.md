# iTunesImportAnalyzer    
simple way to analyze m3u8 files and paths before importing, because iTunes does not provide import error logging    


Tested with Python 3.8.3    

Example: Have your music folders/files and .m3u8 playlist files in directory "mainfolder/Master/320"    
Run >python analyze.py from "mainfolder"    
It will alert you if some paths are too long
